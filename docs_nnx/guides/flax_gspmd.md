# Scale up on multiple devices

This guide shows how to scale up [Flax NNX Modules](https://flax-nnx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.nnx/module.html#flax.nnx.Module) on multiple devices and hosts using [JAX just-in-time compilation machinery](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/02-jitting.html).

+++

## Overview

Flax relies on JAX for numeric computations and for scaling the computations up across multiple devices (GPU, TPU, etc), and the core of scaling up is using [JAX's just-in-time compiler](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.jit.html). Throughout this guide, we will mainly use [`nnx.jit`](https://flax-nnx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.nnx/transforms.html#flax.nnx.jit) which wraps `jax.jit` and works more conveniently with NNX modules.

JAX compilation follows the [Single Program Multi Data (SPMD)](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-SPMD) paradigm. This means you write Python code as if it runs only on one device, and `jit` will automatically compile and run it on multiple devices.

To ensure the compilation performance, you often need to tell JAX how your model's variables are supposed to be sharded across devices. This is where Flax's [Sharding Metadata API](https://flax-nnx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.nnx/spmd.html) comes in - to help you annotate your model variables with this information.

> **NOTE to Flax Linen users**: this API is pretty much the same with what you may have learnt in [the Linen version](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/parallel_training/flax_on_pjit.html) on model definition level, but the top-level code will be simpler due to the benefits of NNX, and some text explanation will be more updated and clear.

You can learn more about JAX APIs for scaling up in [JAX in multi-process environments](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multi_process.html) and [Distributed arrays and automatic parallelization](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Distributed_arrays_and_automatic_parallelization.html) on JAX's documentation site.

### Setup

Import some necessary dependencies.

**Note:** This guide uses the `--xla_force_host_platform_device_count=8` flag to emulate multiple devices in a CPU environment in a Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook. You don't need this if you are already using a multi-device TPU environment.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import os
os.environ["XLA_FLAGS"] = '--xla_force_host_platform_device_count=8'
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
from typing import *

import numpy as np
import jax
from jax import numpy as jnp
from jax.sharding import Mesh, PartitionSpec, NamedSharding

from flax import nnx

import optax # Optax for common losses and optimizers.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(f'We have 8 fake JAX devices now: {jax.devices()}')
```

The code below shows how to import and set up the JAX-level device API, following JAX's [Distributed arrays and automatic parallelization](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Distributed_arrays_and_automatic_parallelization.html) guide:

1. Start a 2x4 device `mesh` (8 devices) using JAX's `mesh_utils.create_device_mesh`. This layout is the same as the one of a [TPU v3-8](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/system-architecture-tpu-vm#single_tpu_board).

2. Annotate each axis with a name using the `axis_names` parameter in `jax.sharding.Mesh`. A typical way to annotate axis names is `axis_name=('data', 'model')`, where:
  * `'data'`: the mesh dimension used for data-parallel sharding of the batch dimension of inputs and activations.
  * `'model'`: the mesh dimension used for sharding parameters of the model across devices.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Create a mesh of two dimensions and annotate each axis with a name.
mesh = Mesh(devices=np.array(jax.devices()).reshape(2, 4),
            axis_names=('data', 'model'))
print(mesh)
```

## Define a model with specified sharding

Create an example layer called `DotReluDot`. This layer carries out two dot product multiplication upon the input `x`, and uses the `jax.nn.relu` (ReLU) activation function in-between.

To annotate a model variable with their ideal sharding, you can use [`flax.nnx.with_partitioning`](https://flax-nnx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.nnx/spmd.html#flax.nnx.with_partitioning) to wrap over its initializer function. Essentially, this calls [`flax.nnx.with_metadata`](https://flax-nnx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.nnx/variables.html#flax.nnx.with_metadata) which adds a `.sharding` attribute field to the corresponding `nnx.Variable`.

Note that this annotation will be [preserved and adjusted accordingly across lifted transformations](https://flax-nnx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/transforms.html#axes-metadata). This means if you use sharding annotations along with any transform that modifies axes (like `nnx.vmap`, `nnx.scan`), you need to provide sharding of that additional axis via the `transform_metadata` arg. Check out the [NNX transforms guide](https://flax-nnx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/transforms.html) to learn more.

```{code-cell} ipython3
class DotReluDot(nnx.Module):
  def __init__(self, depth: int, rngs: nnx.Rngs):
    init_fn = nnx.initializers.lecun_normal()

    # Initialize a sublayer `self.dot1` and annotate its kernel with
    # sharding (None, 'model')
    self.dot1 = nnx.Linear(
      depth, depth,
      kernel_init=nnx.with_partitioning(init_fn, (None, 'model')),
      use_bias=False,  # or use `bias_init` to give it annotation too
      rngs=rngs)

    # Initialize a weight param `w2` and annotate with sharding ('model', None)
    # Note that this is simply adding `.sharding` to the variable as metadata!
    self.w2 = nnx.Param(
      init_fn(rngs.params(), (depth, depth)),  # RNG key and shape for W2 creation
      sharding=('model', None),
    )

  def __call__(self, x: jax.Array):
    y = self.dot1(x)
    y = jax.nn.relu(y)
    # In data parallelism, input / intermediate value's first dimension (batch)
    # will be sharded on `data` axis
    y = jax.lax.with_sharding_constraint(y, PartitionSpec('data', 'model'))
    z = jnp.dot(y, self.w2.value)
    return z
```

### Understand sharding names

The so-called "sharding annotations" are essentially tuples of device axis names like `'data'`, `'model'` or `None`. This describes how each dimension of this JAX array should be sharded â€” either across one of the device mesh dimensions, or not sharded at all.

So, when you define `W1` with shape `(depth, depth)` and annotate as `(None, 'model')`:

* The first dimension will be replicated across all devices.
* The second dimension will be sharded over the `'model'` axis of the device mesh. This means `W1` will be sharded 4-way on devices `(0, 4)`, `(1, 5)`, `(2, 6)` and `(3, 7)`, on this dimension.

JAX's [Distributed arrays and automatic parallelization](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Distributed_arrays_and_automatic_parallelization.html) guide offers more examples and explanations.

+++

## Initialize a sharded model

Now we have annotations attached to the `nnx.Variable`, but the actual weights haven't been sharded yet. If you just go ahead and create this model, all JAX arrays are still stuck in device 0. In practice, you'd want to avoid this, because a large model will OOM in this situation, and all the other devices are not utilized.

```{code-cell} ipython3
unsharded_model = DotReluDot(1024, rngs=nnx.Rngs(0))

# We have annotations sticked there, yay!
print(unsharded_model.dot1.kernel.sharding)     # (None, 'model')
print(unsharded_model.w2.sharding)              # ('model', None)

# But the actual arrays are not sharded... wut?
print(unsharded_model.dot1.kernel.value.sharding)  # SingleDeviceSharding
print(unsharded_model.w2.value.sharding)           # SingleDeviceSharding
```

We should leverage JAX's compilation mechanism, via `nnx.jit`, to create the sharded model. The key is to intialize a model and assign shardings upon the model state within a jitted function:

1. Use [`nnx.get_partition_spec`](https://flax-nnx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.nnx/spmd.html#flax.nnx.get_partition_spec) to strip out the `.sharding` annotations attached upon model variables;

1. Call [`jax.lax.with_sharding_constraint`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.with_sharding_constraint.html) to bind the model state with the sharding annotations. This API tells the top-level `jit` how to shard a variable!

1. Throw away the unsharded state and return the model based upon the sharded state.

1. Compile the whole function with `nnx.jit`, which allows the output to be a stateful NNX module.

1. Run it under a device mesh context so that JAX knows which devices to shard it to.

The whole compiled `create_sharded_model` will directly generate a model with sharded JAX arrays, and no single-device OOM will happen!

```{code-cell} ipython3
@nnx.jit
def create_sharded_model():
  model = DotReluDot(1024, rngs=nnx.Rngs(0)) # unsharded at this moment
  state = nnx.state(model)                   # the model's state, a pure pytree
  pspecs = nnx.get_partition_spec(state)     # strip out the annotations from state
  sharded_state = jax.lax.with_sharding_constraint(state, pspecs)
  nnx.update(model, sharded_state)           # model is sharded now!
  return model

with mesh:
  sharded_model = create_sharded_model()

# They are some `GSPMDSharding` now - not single device!
print(sharded_model.dot1.kernel.value.sharding)
print(sharded_model.w2.value.sharding)

# Check out their equivalency with some easier-to-read sharding descriptions
assert sharded_model.dot1.kernel.value.sharding.is_equivalent_to(
  NamedSharding(mesh, PartitionSpec(None, 'model')), ndim=2
)
assert sharded_model.w2.value.sharding.is_equivalent_to(
  NamedSharding(mesh, PartitionSpec('model', None)), ndim=2
)
```

You can view the sharding of any 1-D or 2-D array with `jax.debug.visualize_array_sharding`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print("sharded_model.dot1.kernel (None, 'model') :")
jax.debug.visualize_array_sharding(sharded_model.dot1.kernel.value)
print("sharded_model.w2 ('model', None) :")
jax.debug.visualize_array_sharding(sharded_model.w2.value)
```

### On `jax.lax.with_sharding_constraint`

The key to shard a JAX array is to call `jax.lax.with_sharding_constraint` inside a jitted function. Note that it will throw an error if not under a JAX device mesh context.

You may have noticed we also used `jax.lax.with_sharding_constraint` once in the model definition too, to contraint the sharding of an intermediate value. This is just to show that you can always use it orthogonally with the Flax API, if you want to explicitly shard values that are not model variables.

This brings a question: Why use the Flax annotation API then? Why not just add JAX sharding constraints inside the model definition? The most important reason is that you still need the explicit annotations to load a sharded model from an on-disk checkpoint. See the section below.

+++

## Load sharded model from checkpoint

Now we can initialize a sharded model without OOM, but what about loading it from a checkpoint on disk? JAX checkpointing libraries like [Orbax](https://orbax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) usually supports loading it sharded if a sharding pytree is given.

You can generate such as sharding pytree with `nnx.get_named_sharding`. To avoid any real memory allocation, use `nnx.eval_shape` to generate a model of abstract JAX arrays, and only use its `.sharding` annotations to obtain the sharding tree.

Below is an example demonstration using Orbax's `StandardCheckpointer` API. Check out [Orbax website](https://orbax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to learn their latest updates and recommended APIs.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import orbax.checkpoint as ocp

# Save the sharded state
sharded_state = nnx.state(sharded_model)
path = ocp.test_utils.erase_and_create_empty('/tmp/my-checkpoints/')
checkpointer = ocp.StandardCheckpointer()
checkpointer.save(path / 'checkpoint_name', sharded_state)

# Load a sharded state from checkpoint, without `sharded_model` or `sharded_state`
abs_model = nnx.eval_shape(lambda: DotReluDot(1024, rngs=nnx.Rngs(0)))
abs_state = nnx.state(abs_model)
# Orbax API expects a tree of abstract `jax.ShapeDtypeStruct`
# that contains both sharding and the shape/dtype of the arrays.
abs_state = jax.tree.map(
  lambda a, s: jax.ShapeDtypeStruct(a.shape, a.dtype, sharding=s),
  abs_state, nnx.get_named_sharding(abs_state, mesh)
)
loaded_sharded = checkpointer.restore(path / 'checkpoint_name',
                                      args=ocp.args.StandardRestore(abs_state))
jax.debug.visualize_array_sharding(loaded_sharded.dot1.kernel.value)
jax.debug.visualize_array_sharding(loaded_sharded.w2.value)
```

## Compile the training loop

Now, from initialization or from checkpoint, we have a sharded model. To carry out the compiled, scaled up training, we need to shard the inputs as well. In this data parallelism example, the training data has its batch dimension sharded across `data` device axis, so you should put your data in sharding `('data', None)`. You can use `jax.device_put` for this.

Note that with the correct sharding for all inputs, the output will be sharded in the most natural way even without JIT compilation. See the example below - even without `jax.lax.with_sharding_constraint` on the output `y`, it was still sharded as `('data', None)`.

> If you are interested in why: The second matmul of `DotReluDot.__call__` has two inputs of sharding `('data', 'model')` and `('model', None)`, in which both inputs' contraction axis are `model`. So a reduce-scatter matmul happened and will natually shard the output as `('data', None)`. Check out the [JAX shard map collective guide](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/shard_map.html#example-2-psum-scatter-the-result) and its examples if you want to learn mathematically how it happened at low level.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# In data parallelism, the first dimension (batch) will be sharded on `data` axis
data_sharding = NamedSharding(mesh, PartitionSpec('data', None))
input = jax.device_put(jnp.ones((8, 1024)), data_sharding)

with mesh:
  output = sharded_model(input)
print(output.shape)
jax.debug.visualize_array_sharding(output)  # Also sharded as ('data', None)
```

Now the rest of the training loop is pretty conventional - almost the same as the example in [NNX Basics](https://flax-nnx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nnx_basics.html#transforms), except that the inputs and labels are also explicitly sharded.

`nnx.jit` will adjust and automatically choose the best layout based on how its inputs are already sharded, so try out different shardings for your own model and inputs.

```{code-cell} ipython3
optimizer = nnx.Optimizer(sharded_model, optax.adam(1e-3))  # reference sharing

@nnx.jit
def train_step(model, optimizer, x, y):
  def loss_fn(model: DotReluDot):
    y_pred = model(x)
    return jnp.mean((y_pred - y) ** 2)

  loss, grads = nnx.value_and_grad(loss_fn)(model)
  optimizer.update(grads)

  return loss

input = jax.device_put(jax.random.normal(jax.random.key(1), (8, 1024)), data_sharding)
label = jax.device_put(jax.random.normal(jax.random.key(2), (8, 1024)), data_sharding)

with mesh:
  for i in range(5):
    loss = train_step(sharded_model, optimizer, input, label)
    print(loss)    # model (over-)fitting to the labels quickly
```

## Profiling

If you are running on a TPU pod or a pod slice, you can use a custom `block_all` utility function, as defined below, to measure the performance:

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%timeit

def block_all(xs):
  jax.tree_util.tree_map(lambda x: x.block_until_ready(), xs)
  return xs

with mesh:
  new_state = block_all(train_step(sharded_model, optimizer, input, label))
```

## Logical axis annotation

JAX's automatic SPMD encourages users to explore different sharding layouts to find the optimal one. To this end, in Flax you have the option to annotate with more descriptive axis names (not just device mesh axis names like `'data'` and `'model'`), as long as you provide a mapping from your alias to the device mesh axes.

You can provide the mapping along with the annotation as another metadata of the corresponding `nnx.Variable`, or overwrite it at top-level. Check out the `LogicalDotReluDot` example below.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# The mapping from alias annotation to device mesh
sharding_rules = (('batch', 'data'), ('hidden', 'model'), ('embed', None))

class LogicalDotReluDot(nnx.Module):
  def __init__(self, depth: int, rngs: nnx.Rngs):
    init_fn = nnx.initializers.lecun_normal()

    # Initialize a sublayer `self.dot1`
    self.dot1 = nnx.Linear(
      depth, depth,
      kernel_init=nnx.with_metadata(
        # We provide the sharding rules here
        init_fn, sharding=('embed', 'hidden'), sharding_rules=sharding_rules),
      use_bias=False,
      rngs=rngs)

    # Initialize a weight param `w2`
    self.w2 = nnx.Param(
      # We didn't provide the sharding rules here - to show you how to overwrite it later
      nnx.with_metadata(init_fn, sharding=('hidden', 'embed'))(
        rngs.params(), (depth, depth))
    )

  def __call__(self, x: jax.Array):
    y = self.dot1(x)
    y = jax.nn.relu(y)
    # Unfortunately the logical aliasing doesn't work on lower-level JAX calls
    y = jax.lax.with_sharding_constraint(y, PartitionSpec('data', None))
    z = jnp.dot(y, self.w2.value)
    return z
```

If you didn't provide all `sharding_rule` annotations in model definition, you can write a few lines to add it to `nnx.State` of the model, before the call of `nnx.get_partition_spec` or `nnx.get_named_sharding`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def add_sharding_rule(vs: nnx.VariableState) -> nnx.VariableState:
  vs.sharding_rules = sharding_rules
  return vs

@nnx.jit
def create_sharded_logical_model():
  model = LogicalDotReluDot(1024, rngs=nnx.Rngs(0))
  state = nnx.state(model)
  state = jax.tree.map(add_sharding_rule, state,
                       is_leaf=lambda x: isinstance(x, nnx.VariableState))
  pspecs = nnx.get_partition_spec(state)
  sharded_state = jax.lax.with_sharding_constraint(state, pspecs)
  nnx.update(model, sharded_state)
  return model

with mesh:
  sharded_logical_model = create_sharded_logical_model()

jax.debug.visualize_array_sharding(sharded_logical_model.dot1.kernel.value)
jax.debug.visualize_array_sharding(sharded_logical_model.w2.value)

# Check out their equivalency with some easier-to-read sharding descriptions
assert sharded_logical_model.dot1.kernel.value.sharding.is_equivalent_to(
  NamedSharding(mesh, PartitionSpec(None, 'model')), ndim=2
)
assert sharded_logical_model.w2.value.sharding.is_equivalent_to(
  NamedSharding(mesh, PartitionSpec('model', None)), ndim=2
)

with mesh:
  logical_output = sharded_logical_model(input)
  assert logical_output.sharding.is_equivalent_to(
    NamedSharding(mesh, PartitionSpec('data', None)), ndim=2
  )
```

### When to use device axis / logical axis

Choosing when to use a device or logical axis depends on how much you want to control the partitioning of your model:

* **Device mesh axis**:

  * For simpler model, this can save you a few extra lines of code of converting the logical naming back to the device naming.

  * Shardings of intermediate *activation* values can only be done via `jax.lax.with_sharding_constraint` and device mesh axis. So if you want super fine-grained control over your model's sharding, directly using device mesh axis names everywhere might be less confusing.

* **Logical naming**: Helpful if you want to experiment around and find the most optimal partition layout for your *model weights*.
