    "\n",
    "In this guide, you will learn about [`flax.training.checkpoints`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.training.html#module-flax.training.checkpoints) — a simplistic and generic checkpointing library built into Flax. Flax allows you to save and load model parameters, metadata, and a variety of Python data using the library [Orbax](https://github.com/google/orbax), which provides a more customizable and flexible API for various array types and storage formats. In addition, Flax provides basic features for versioning, automatic bookkeeping of past checkpoints, and asynchronous saving to reduce training wait time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **_Ongoing migration:_** In the foreseeable future, Flax's checkpointing functionality will gradually be migrated to Orbax. All existed features in the Flax API will continue to be supported, though the API will change. You are encouraged to try out the new API by creating an `orbax.Checkpointer` and pass it in your Flax API calls as arg `orbax_checkpointer`. You may use this page as the most up-to-date code examples to use Orbax-Flax checkpointing.\n",

This kind of data array needs a special experimental JAX API — [`gda_serialization`](https://github.com/google/jax/blob/c7dcd0913bc8b4878a7e45184553c331254b801a/jax/experimental/gda_serialization/serialization.py) — to save and restore checkpoints.
